This August, I was able to be a part of the Huawei Seeds For The Future Program 2025 held in Dongguan and Shenzhen, China!

The Huawei Seeds for the Future Program is Huawei’s flagship talent development initiative, designed to immerse students in cutting-edge digital technology, industry innovation, and cross-cultural exchange, all while fostering an entrepreneurial spirit.

We had the privilege of connecting with peers from Tajikistan, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Trinidad and Tobago, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Guatemala. <br><br> These interactions reminded me that while cultures differ, the language of technology is truly universal.

On the academic side, we explored the interconnectivity of Artificial Intelligence, 5G, and Cloud Computing: The program reminded me that digital progress is not just about tools, but about people, and how we use technology to uplift communities. <br><br>

Beyond the classroom, we journeyed through Dongguan and Shenzhen, visiting Huawei’s flagship store, Tencent headquarters, the Shenzhen Museum, exhibition halls, and even government agencies. These visits opened my eyes to how deeply integrated technology is in every aspect of daily life, from commerce to culture, from governance to recreation.

<br><br> In the end, the program was more than a trip; it was an experience of growth, discovery, and inspiration. It reinforced my passion for technology and my belief that young people from Jamaica and the wider Caribbean have a critical role to play as digital change-makers of the future.

	<h2> My hobbies, and why <b> you </b> need one </h2>

For over half a decade, I’ve been doing one main hobby in my freetime, like many young adults today. What is that hobby, you may be asking? <br> Watching TV Shows. Now, I know that may not be a shock to many but that is my favourite pastime. <br><br> However the shows I watch vary in genre and definitely vary in language. I love watching shows primarily in Spanish, Korean and of course, Chinese. <br><br> I have a passion for learning languages and definitely my hobbies embody that passion as in my free time I enjoy being immersed in other cultures, as in my opinion, TV Shows are not only entertainment, but also a cultural experience.

From a TV Show and movies, you can learn the language of the country, including colloquial terms you may not hear unless you visit, along with the culture of food, music, etc. <br><br> However, I will concede that being cooped up at home all day watching shows is not the best idea, as time spent on screens could be spent outside talking with friends or building connections with others. So it is important to find a balance in hobbies, which I am currently working on. <br><br> And for sure, if we all do something we enjoy in our free time, we can be more present persons in our everyday lives. That’s it from me, until next time! But before we go, what are your hobbies?
